QUESTION 1
I created a Basketball fan website,that people will use to learn more about basketball
QUESTION 2
  1.
1.<nav>-structuring navigation links was initially challenging.
2.<img>-centering and resizing images was also a challenge.
3.<artical>-knowing when to use it instead of <section> was confusing at first.
4.<section>-understanding how to divide content meaningfully took practice.
5.<footer>-deciding what information belongs in the footer needed planning.
  2.
- <artical> for individual position descriptions
- <header> for the website title and introduction

  QUESTION 3

 1.src-used to load images on <img>

    2.
- class was used for styling and grouping multiple elements like centering multiple sections.
